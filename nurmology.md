# Introduction to Numerology

## What is Numerology?
Numerology is the study of the mystical significance of numbers and their influence on human life. It is based on the idea that numbers have symbolic meanings and can reveal insights about personality, destiny, and life path.

## History of Numerology
Numerology has ancient roots and has been practiced in various cultures:
- **Babylonian and Egyptian civilizations** used numbers for divination.
- **Pythagoras**, a Greek philosopher, is considered the father of modern numerology.
- Numerology has evolved through the centuries and is now used in personal development and spiritual practices.

## Core Concepts in Numerology

### 1. Life Path Number
- Represents your overall personality and life purpose.
- Calculated from your birth date.
- Example: If born on July 20, 1990 → 7 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 9 + 9 + 0 = 28 → 2 + 8 = **10** → 1 + 0 = **1**

### 2. Destiny Number (Expression Number)
- Reflects your talents, abilities, and goals.
- Calculated from the full name using numerology chart (A=1, B=2, ..., I=9, J=1, ..., Z=8).
- Example: Name "John Doe" → J(1) + O(6) + H(8) + N(5) + D(4) + O(6) + E(5) = 35 → 3 + 5 = **8**

### 3. Soul Urge Number
- Reveals your inner desires and motivations.
- Calculated from the vowels in your full name.
- Example: Name "John Doe" → O(6) + O(6) + E(5) = 17 → 1 + 7 = **8**

## How Numbers Are Calculated
- Each letter is assigned a number from 1 to 9.
- Numbers are reduced to a single digit unless they are master numbers (11, 22, 33).
- Master numbers are considered powerful and are not reduced further.
