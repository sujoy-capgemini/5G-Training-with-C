# 5G Technology Overview

## What is 5G?

**5G** is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology offering:
- Faster data speeds
- Lower latency (delay)
- Greater connectivity

---

## Why 5G is Needed

1. **Higher Speed**  
   - Up to 300 Mbps, extendable to 10 Gbps

2. **Ultra Low Latency**  
   - LTE: 300â€“500 ms  
   - 5G: As low as 1 ms

3. **Massive Device Connectivity**  
   - LTE: Supports thousands of devices per square kilometer  
   - 5G: Supports up to 1 million devices per square kilometer

4. **Energy Efficiency**

5. **Network Slicing**  
   - Enables virtual networks on the same physical infrastructure

6. **Beamforming Technology**

## 5G Architecture

5G architecture has three main components:

1. **UE (User Equipment)**  
   - Devices used by end-users to access the 5G network

2. **NG-RAN (Next Generation Radio Access Network)**  
   - Uses **5G NR (New Radio)** technology  
   - Based on **gNB (Next Generation NodeB)**

3. **5GC (5G Core Network)**  
   - Manages connections, mobility, and services
