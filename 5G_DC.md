# Dual Connectivity (DC) in 5G Networks

## Overview

Dual Connectivity allows a User Equipment (UE), such as a smartphone, to connect to two different base stations simultaneously:

- **Master Node (MN)**
- **Secondary Node (SN)**

This setup enhances:

- Data throughput
- Network reliability
- Mobility performance

## ðŸ§± Types of Dual Connectivity in 5G

### 1. EN-DC (E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity)
- **Master Node**: LTE eNB
- **Secondary Node**: 5G gNB
- **Deployment**: Used in 5G NSA (Non-Standalone) deployments

### 2. NE-DC (NR-E-UTRA Dual Connectivity)
- **Master Node**: 5G gNB
- **Secondary Node**: LTE eNB
- **Deployment**: Used in 5G SA (Standalone) with LTE fallback

### 3. NR-DC (NR-NR Dual Connectivity)
- **Master Node**: 5G gNB
- **Secondary Node**: Another 5G gNB
- **Deployment**: Used in pure 5G deployments
